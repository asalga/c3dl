# C3DL
#
# This script will generate the c3DL documentation for the developers working with the library directly.
# These documents should not be used by users of the library who are simply making use of the libary by 
# creating games,demos, etc. Users should instead download the user documentation from www.c3dl.org 
#
#
# It was decided not to use the -a(all) flag when running the tool to prevent accidental inclusion
# of js files which should not be included to be documented.  If a new file is added to the 
# library, its respective line must be added here.
# 
# The following arguments are used when generating the documentation.
#
# -p (private) = Include symbols tagged as private, underscored and inner symbols. Since we are documenting 
#      the entire library, we want all code
#
# -v (verbose) = Displays what the tool is doing on the console.
#
# -t (template) = The template used.
#
# -d (destination) = The directory where the generated files should be placed.
