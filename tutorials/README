NOTE: the code in the tutorials are not 100% identical to that on the website.
It is designed to work with the canvas3dapi folder being 2 folders up and not one
folder out.  If you had gotten the repository, you should be able to run the
the tutorials directory by loading the index.html file in each subdirecotry.
